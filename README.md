MRE Class 1 Homework
As an early retired teacher, I have continued to look for learning opportunities. I enjoyed using technology in the classroom and applied it daily towards lessons to inspire my students. Now I am enjoying technology as a hobby and want to expand my abilities in VR. This class will further develop my world building skills Altspace for fun.
